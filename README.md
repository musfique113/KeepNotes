# Keepnotes

## Description
FlutterKeep is a note-taking app built using Flutter that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. 

It utilizes Firebase and SQLite as the back-end for seamless synchronization across devices. Similar to Google Keep, FlutterKeep offers a clean and intuitive interface for users to quickly jot down their thoughts and ideas, set reminders, and organize their notes with labels and colors. 

With FlutterKeep, users can access their notes from anywhere and never have to worry about losing their notes again.
